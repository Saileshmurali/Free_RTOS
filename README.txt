# Free_RTOS
This repository contains free RTOS used in STM32F4 discovery board with cubemx configuration using the CMSIS library for implementing Free RTOS. 
1. Basic_task.c file contains three tasks two of which is toggling of onboard LED connected at PD12 and PD13 at 250 and 500 ms respectively. The third task is toggling LED connected at PD14 when the onboard pushbutton connected to PA0 is used. This has been given the lowest priority. Note that all the three tasks will be implemented only when the task three, the one which involves push button has the least priority. Otherwise, since polling is used, the system CPU time will be allocated to task 3 alone and other tasks won't be executed                                                    
2. Binary Semaphore Priority Inversion file has three tasks, task 1,2,3 in decreasing order of priority. Task 1 and 3 operate based on binary semaphore, while task 2 is independent of it. When we connect the push button PA0 pin as the trigger action for the task 3 (lowest priority), it is in polling until the event occurs. In the meantime, task 1 isn't able to continue with its work because the semaphore isn't released by task 3. This creates a priority inversion as a higher priority task now waits for a lower priority one to complete its work. On the other hand, you can see the task 2 (medium task being) executed as per the code because it doesn't depend on the semaphore for its implementation
